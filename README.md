<h1 align="center"> Cabricality </h1>

Cabricality is a **Create centered** challenge Minecraft Modpack for **Quilt 1.18.2**. With this pack, you can follow the quests and build your own factory with [Create](https://github.com/Fabricators-of-Create/Create) and [Industrial Revolution](https://github.com/GabrielOlvH/Industrial-Revolution). From shoveling clays to building space stations, you can develop your technology as you want.

This pack is inspired from [Create: Above and Beyond](https://github.com/simibubi/Above-and-Beyond) and based on it, so it includes almost all the main features what Create: Above and Beyond has introduced.

## Features

### Thread Based

As a tech pack, Cabricality has a **main thread** of the development of technologies. Aside from the main thread, there are **sub threads** for the unnecessary technology development. This can let you get rid of messed up technologies in some kitchen sink packs, and you can organize yourself with the rich-description quests.

### Rich Quests

In the quests you can check for chapters and milestones in the `Overview` tab, and complete them in your own way. After completing a chapter, you will get a new set of assemble line that done by yourself and gain more mechanics for machine making.

### Automation Required

Nearly all contraptions and materials for the machines are needed to be automated by you and your factory. The design of the automation contraptions would be painful, but after automating all the materials, you will achieve the current milestone and step into the next one.

### Trading System

After automating brass machines, you can make a lot of trade stations, which requires energy to work. With the help of trade cards and profession cards, you can sell and buy what you want using your resources and coins. 

When you start to make an Enderium automation line which requires silver ingots, you will find that the only way to obtain silver before the chaotic alchemist is through trading and obtaining silver coins, so the trading system is not only useful but also necessary.

### Chaotic Alchemist

You can infuse dust with molten glass to make substrates as glass jars. By alchemist mixing and alchemist smelting and the help of catalysts, you are able to convert matters into new matters just like chemical reactions.

To obtain the catalysts, you will need to learn the usage of laser emitters. It can send a chain of laser boom and combine substrates in front of it into catalyst if the kind of substrates are right. This kind of recipe are depends on your world's seeds. Once you found the correct recipe, the things will be easier to play around with.

### Space Exploration

The final goal of this modpack is get to the moon. But it's not the end. You can build better rockets with the materials that won't generate on earth to further plants or galaxies. You can also build space stations on planet orbits for deeper research.

### Good Optimization

Optimization of this modpack is better than Create: Above and Beyond. You can play this modpack with higher FPS (turn vsync off if possible). If you have problems with TPS, try to create a world using Creative mode then switch it to Survival mode.
