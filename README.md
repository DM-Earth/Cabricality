# Cabricality

[Create: Above and Beyond](https://github.com/simibubi/Above-and-Beyond) but for **Fabric 1.18.2** using **Create 0.5**.

Cabricality aims to port the CAB experience to Fabric, but not 1:1 clone it to Fabric so there're a lot of differences between them.

## Compare Between Original CAB Modpack

- [X] Create 0.3.2g -> Create 0.5
- [X] Thermal Series -> Kibe, Indrev
- [ ] TConstruct - - waiting for [this Fabric port](https://github.com/Alpha-s-Stuff/TinkersConstruct) by AlphaMode, now is partly impled by KubeJS.
- [X] AE2 = AE2
- [X] Advanced Rocketry -> Agape Space
