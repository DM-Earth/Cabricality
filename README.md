Cabricality is a Create centered challenging Minecraft Modpack for **Quilt 1.18.2**. With this pack, you can follow the quests and build your own factory. From shoveling clays to building space stations, you can develop your technology as you want.

This pack is inspired from [Create: Above and Beyond](https://github.com/simibubi/Above-and-Beyond) and based on it, so it has almost all the main features what Create: Above and Beyond introduced.
