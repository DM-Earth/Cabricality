## 游戏内容

### 主线流程

As a technical modpack, Cabricality has a **main thread** of technology developments. Aside from it, there are **sub threads** of unnecessary technologies.

The **well-descripted** quests will surely set you up goals before every tech term. Don't worry, with us, you will be neither stressed out nor puzzled.

### 任务指引

Lying on the left of the quest page, `Overview` is where you can unlock and review all the **chapters** and **milestones** in a glance. Every chapter has it's unique assemble lines, and brand new adventures.

Well, quests are just helpful tools we have prepared for you. It's absolutely at your will to choose to experience the pack in your own way!

### 机械纪元

Nearly all machine necessities are **automatable.** It may be painful to reasonably divide the occupied area and functions of machinery, but as the old saying goes, no pains no gains. After all, you'll be able to unlock milestones and have encompassing visions of your magnificant factory!

### 幻想交易

You will have the ability to produce **trade stations** when brass supply is sufficient. When you plug the precise instrument on with adequate energy, it roars. With the help of `trade cards` and `profession cards`, some rarely seen materials could be exchanged by coins, and the process can also **be reversed.** Ah, my precious!

The system is poorly needed during the produce of `enderium` materials. The queer material born in anotherland, combines silver coins in a mysterious way. If you aren't an alchemist, the only way to obtain them is through trade.

### 混沌炼金

Substrates caged in glass jars break into pieces of treasure at the presence of an alchemist. You can do it too! Infust dusts to molten glass yields substrates, and after mixing and smelting and the help of catalysts, **matters manufacture matters.** It's magic!

Catalysts aren't that easy to obtain. Struct a **laser emmitter** and let the particle ray combine right substrates into exact catalysts. The recipe is randomly different between worlds, so excite yourself to find the right ones!

### 苍穹之际

You might leave behind quests by landing on the moon, but your story never ends. **Ad astra** made exploring other planets and galaxies possible, what's more, you can build your space stations outside atmospheres!

*Deeper adventure awaits, don't stop, Hitch Hiker!*

### 自定义

We prefer you to optimize your games on your own.

**If you want a higher FPS(Frames per second),** vsync may help. **When the TPS(Ticks per second) is badly low,** try to enter a new world in `Creative Mode` before you switch to other modes you like.

If you like to write scripts and add your favorites to the game, **you're welcome!**

## 技术支持

**所有的技术细节都可以在此GitHub仓库中找到。如果你想追踪日后的开发进度，请`Watch`此仓库。**

此整合包使用[packwiz](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz)管理和打包内容，并以[Modrinth整合包](https://docs.modrinth.com/docs/modpacks/format_definition/)格式发布。

### 手动构建

你需要在本地克隆此仓库，并在仓库根目录下载[packwiz](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz)。一切准备就绪后，请运行以下命令：

**macOS / Linux:**

```
./packwiz modrinth export
```

**Windows:**

```
packwiz modrinth export
```

如果你想通过CurseForge整合包格式打包，请使用`packwiz curseforge export`命令[^curseforge]。

[^curseforge]: 不建议这样做，因为大部分模组都导入自Modrinth。
