  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.ceaseless_impetus_b": "In addition to a more sturdy design made out of hallowed gold, the ceaseless impetus allows for two uses before needing repair.

  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.crucible_acceleration_a": "The crucible is a rather heavy and slow piece of spirit engineering, and that is not without a reason. For you see; the impetus can be really easily damaged, the process of spirit focusing heavily relies on a slow and constant input of arcana to not cause unnecessary damage to the catalyst.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.crucible_acceleration_b": "Increasing the rate at which arcana is streamed into the impetus would yield a faster result but it could lead to your catalyst getting damaged more than necessary.

For one, infusing earthen arcana into items is bound to reinforce them. For two, advanced earthen magic can be used to bring forth new ground into the world. This potent wizardry is rather uncommon, only found within certain passive and sturdy souls.",

  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.ether_a": "Nowadays, most magics offer you a unique source of light for all purpose use, spirit arcana is no different. Ether, known to some as Nitor is a magical flame that burns and shines bright forever. It can be placed on a torch or a magical brazier which can be placed or hung.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.ether_b": "Additionally, the ether flame can be dyed into practically any color. Simply combine the ether item with any combination of dyes and it's light will be altered. For technical reasons monochromatic dyes may yield possibly undesirable results without other dyes mixed in.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.expanded_focusing_a": "Furthermore, arcane restoration isn't restricted to just repairing your impetus; it extends much further. Using the restoring process you may repair any one of your damaged items.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.expanded_focusing_b": "Each item will require a unique set of spirits that need to be slotted in the crucible as well as a valid repair ingredient aimed at the crucible in the twisted tablet.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.expanded_focusing_c": "Additionally, gear closely connected with spirit arcana can be repaired more efficiently.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.hallowed_gold_a": "Gold is very often used as a basis for various magics, this is also the case with spirit arcana. Infusing arcane and sacred arcana into a gold ingot will imbue it with magic and yield a much more desirable magic metal. A few additional reagents are also needed for this process.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.hallowed_gold_b": "While not too useful in evil schemes or crafting powerful gear, hallowed gold is a metal perfect for spirit manipulation and transfer.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.haunted": "When a soul is hurt some of it's magic is lost. The haunted enchantment converts that magic energy into extra magic damage to anyone you strike. Higher tiers hit with even stronger magic.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.hex_ash": "Hex ash is a simple magical powder used in various infusions as a minor component. The ash is known for it's ability to animate objects, even bring some to life in some extreme cases.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.holy_sap_a": "Within the runewood trees a special type of sap is created. To get your hands on this holy extract you'll need an axe. Start by stripping off the bark of an exposed piece of runewood, and then collect it all with a glass bottle.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.holy_sap_b": "Holy sap can be used for quite a few things. Firstly, by combining it with a slimeball you'll obtain several sapballs, which serve the same purpose.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.holy_sap_c": "Secondly, you can create holy syrup by heating up your sap. Drinking this rejuvenating substance will replenish plenty of hunger and even provide you with a healing effect.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.holy_sap_d": "Try your best to not think about reverting sapballs into their slimy precursor using a certain thermal-series centrifugal separator.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.impetus_restoration_a": "When an impetus sustains enough damage it will crack, becoming unusable for spirit focusing. To combat this issue, the crucible has a secondary function known to most as arcane restoration. This process expands on spirit focusing and flips it upside down.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.impetus_restoration_b": "Instead of splitting off mass from our catalyst such as the impetus, arcane restoration utilizes spirit arcana to recover the form of your item. While repairing an impetus with the crucible alone is theorized to be possible, there's no reason not to take the easy way out.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.impetus_restoration_c": "The twisted tablet is a simple augmentation of your usual item stand; the difference is that the tablet has the ability to channel spirit arcana without the need for an outside source to draw it out. It must be placed facing the crucible on a matching axis position.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.infernal_rite": "The infernal rite provides one of many auras. Nearby players will receive haste.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.infernal_spirit_a": "Hellish magic is incredibly dangerous, and by far the most diabolical. Playing with fire is usually not a good idea, unless you're a soul hunter.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.infernal_spirit_b": "Infernal arcana is great at many things: light, explosions, fire, the list goes on. The magic isn't more potent on it's own than a mere flame however it is overly present in certain places. You definitely know where to hunt.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.introduction_a": "Within our world, every living body has a soul. The soul is one's consciousness and what animates the body, a physical vessel for the arcane presence of a soul. Both represent who we are, one is an arcane image, while the other a physical fortress.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.introduction_b": "The Encyclopedia Arcana is a book containing all my gathered research on everything that is known about the soul. To be more exact, this codex focuses on a rather wicked form of arcane arts known as soul magic. It is a very cruel, inhumane and generally frowned upon study of arcana.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.introduction_c": "In order to properly harness the unspoken power of soul magics, you'll have to start with the basics. At the very core of every soul rests an untapped source of power in form of what's known as spirit arcana - fragments of potential.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.introduction_d": "The power of a specific soul derives almost entirely from the spirits found within it's core. These spirits serve as the basis for the very existence of the arcane presence of a soul. Each different soul is one and only, powered by different combinations of eight known types of spirit.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.iridescent_ether_a": "While ether is exceptionally gorgeous, iridescent ether takes this glimmering shine a step further. This pristine form of ether allows you to dye the item once more to alter the ending color of the burn. Much like normal ether it can be placed on a brazier and a torch",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.iridescent_ether_b": "Getting just the right coloring for your light may be a bit tricky however. You cannot alter the original color of ether once it's transformed into it's iridescent variant, applying any dye at this stage will only change the second color.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.magebane_belt": "By twisting a warded belt into it's rather sinister alter ego we may create the magebane belt. This alteration exchanges defense for offense, providing greater magic resistance and extra soul ward. Additionally, any damage absorbed by soul ward will make it's way to the inflicter.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.metallurgic_magic_a": "With some clever tricks you may imbue your impetus with a metallic shell, when fed spirits it'll sprout a metallic node of your desired metal which you may then smelt directly into nuggets. Due to the more rigid material of the impetus, more durability is lost in the process.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.metallurgic_magic_b": "It is speculated that these catalysts were previously used as some sort of ashen aspects in an infernal arcana focused alchemical exchange system. It might be possible to replicate the process by studying the history of infernal arcana.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.mirror_magic": "Coming soon!",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.necklace_of_the_mystic_mirror": "A whole lot of gear, trinkets and armor alike grant an effect when collecting spirits. By utilizing primitive mirror magic we can siphon some raw arcana off of your magic attacks and utilize it to trigger those effects. This necklace does just that.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.necklace_of_the_narrow_edge": "The scythe sweep attack can be extremely useful in clearing through hordes of prey, however in other cases it can be seen as unnecessary or even impractical. This iron necklace will completely remove your scythe's sweep attack in exchange for a strong damage increase.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.rebound": "The rebound enchantment is by far the strangest one of all. It grants you the ability to throw the scythe like a boomerang, allowing for a wacky ranged attack. Higher tiers allow you to throw the scythe more frequently.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.ring_of_curative_talent": "Tears of the ghast have some really strong curative properties. Combining one with some sacred arcana and infusing both into a gilded ring will yield us the ring of curative talent. This simple trinket will recover a large portion of your health when collecting spirits.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.ring_of_prowess_a": "There is another thing besides spirit arcana that the soul holds, it is known as brilliance, or experience. Unlike spirits, brilliance has strong enough ties to the body and some of it is naturally dispersed from the soul upon the defeat of the vessel.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.ring_of_prowess_b": "As with all things, we can't let the soul keep anything for itself. With some clever use of raw arcana combined with natural brilliance we can leech off some extra experience as spirits leave the dying soul. The ring of prowess does just that.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.ring_of_wicked_intent": "The wicked ring is a simple yet practical trinket that will greatly assist you in combat. Taking note from the powerful wither army the ring will react to nearby spirit arcana and reward you with strength and rage when collecting spirits.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.runewood_a": "Similarly to soulstone, the runewood tree is yet another result of uncontrolled soul magic. This time however the nature of the result is much less grim. These trees are known for their life giving sap and for their wood; a fine arcana conductor.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.runewood_b": "Runewood trees are created with arcane and sacred spirit, hence their tame nature. Unlike the soulstone, this process is rather quick in comparison and can easily be replicated with a good understanding of soul magic.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.runewood_c": "Additionally, item holders such as pedestals or stands can be created using runewood planks. These simple receptacles are often used as means of supplying your magical processes with ingredients.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.runewood_d": "The runewood tree can be found commonly within various plains and fields alike, and also rarely within forest biomes.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.runewood_obelisk": "If you've ever wished for a means of speeding up your spirit infusion, the runewood obelisk is perfect for your needs. It functions as a booster pillar of sorts, the spirit arcana imbued within allow it to accelerate the infusion process.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.sacred_rite": "The sacred rite is the simplest rite there is. It'll provide a weak healing effect to all nearby players.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.sacred_spirit_a": "Sacred spirit represents two main concepts, pure beings and holy origins. Sacred arcana is generally focused on various forms of healing and other curative effects.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.sacred_spirit_b": "The sacred spirit is found mainly within passive, relaxed souls. Easy targets really.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.scythes_a": "The scythe is a very popular tool amid soul hunters. For one, it provides a strong sweeping attack even more powerful than that of the sword. Secondly, due to the soulstone augmented into the scythe it's capable of damaging both the soul and body with each attack.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.scythes_b": "When you damage a living body you destroy the vessel of a soul, letting it fade away peacefully into the afterlife. However when you slay a soul, you will shatter it alongside the death of the vessel. This merciless execution denies the soul eternal peace and is your key to obtaining your very first batch of spirit arcana.",
  "malum.gui.book.entry.page.text.scythes_c": "The most primitive scythe available is a crude one, made from iron and a single soulstone.",
