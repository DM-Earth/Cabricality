# Frequently Asked Questions

## About the Game

### How Can I Play the Modpack?

1. [Download the latest version from Releases;](https://github.com/JieningYu/Cabricality/releases)
2. [Install the pack like this.](https://docs.modrinth.com/docs/modpacks/playing_modpacks/)

### I Can't Launch the Game

-   `macOS ONLY` Clean all `.DS_Store` files under your `.minecraft` path.

### I Can't Transfer Items and Fluids Within Indrev Machines

Use the target machine with a `Screwdriver` to configure its input and output faces.

### I Can't Assembly Infernal Mechanism

It's a `Sequenced Assembly` recipe, but due to the existence of a displaying issue of `REI`, you can not check it in game.

Follow the steps below to assembly:

> Fill `13500 dropelets` of `Liquid Soul`,
> Fill `181000 dropelets` of `Lava`;
>
> Repeat them for 3 times.

## About the Chaotic Alchemist

### Structure

You need to place a **Rose Quartz Lamp** and 1 or more **Fixture Lamps** (which are non-shaded and from the LED mod) depend on it, then use redstone signals to light up these small lamps.

To activate the structure, use some kinetic force and a **Deployer** in attack mode (Hold \[W\] in order to figure out how to make it in attack mode) to hit the **Rose Quartz Lamp**. You will discover that there are 'laser beams' (in fact they're just vanilla particles) emitted by these small, activated lamps. Now you can use the laser and **Hopper Minecarts** to process materials and substrates.

### Non-chaotic laser recipes

There are some basic, non-chaotic recipes that you will meet in _Chapter 4_.

> 1 Basalt -> 1 Basalz Shard
>
> 1 Snowball -> 1 Blizz Cube

To process these recipes, put the ingredient in a **Hopper Minecart** and use a laser beam shotting that minecart. After shotted by the laser, some (or all) ingredients in the minecart will be processed, then you can take them out. Be aware that if the recipe was successfully processed, living entities (includes yourself) in a range will be damaged depends on power of the laser.

### Chaotic Alchemy

> Cheating: you can use `/cabricality getAlchemistInformation` in order to get the chaotic recipes if you have OP permission.

In _Chapter 4a_ you will need to make a **Chaotic Catalyst** jar and use it to speed up silicon and silver production. If you follow the quests, you will discover that chaotic catalysts are made from typical catalysts, and typical catalysts are made from typical reagents. These typical reagents are grouped and linked into different catalysts so if you want to make a certain catalyst, you will only need to make these linked reagents.

To produce a typical catalyst you need to first obtain all the reagents linked to it, and you'd better make 16+ of each reagent. For example, Crystalline Catalyst is linked with Certus Quartz, Sulfuric, Blazing Quartz, Cinnabar and Nether Quartz Reagents. Then start to find out the recipe of that catalyst (All chaotic recipes are different by world seed).

The recipe of a catalyst is just like a shaped crafting recipe, but processed using hopper minecarts and laser beams, and the recipe requires 3 different reagents liked with the target catalyst, so that you need to put them ordered in the minecart, and process the ingredients just like those non-chaotic recipes using a laser beam.

If your guess of the recipe was failed, all the ingredients will be costed, but there are some clues for you to figure out the real recipe. If you find some **Redstone** in the cart after hitting with beam, the count of redstone dusts means the count of completely correct reagents (type and place) in your failed try. And if you find some **Shade**, then the count of shade dusts means the count of misplaced correct reagents, which means you need to move some jars.

The production of **Chaotic Catalysts** is pretty similar with the production of typical catalysts, but its recipe requires 3 different typical catalysts compared with the recipe of typical catalysts.

After you obtained a chaotic catalyst, you can start to produce silicon and silver. The recipes of these two reagents are simple, just process a chaotic catalyst and a certain typical reagent in a shapeless way inside the minecart and processed with laser just like other laser recipes. These recipes is also depend on the world's seed.

> Tips: you can sneak-use a reagent jar to get the item inside it and use an empty jar with an reagent-item to put it inside the jar.
